## How to Create the First Release

The repository is now fully prepared. Choose your preferred method:

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
bash scripts/prepare_release.sh --full
```

This will:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Validate repository
3. Run all tests
4. Package MT5 files
5. Create and push tag
6. Trigger GitHub Actions

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
# Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.21.0 -m "Release v1.21.0"
git push origin v1.21.0

# Monitor at: https://github.com/A6-9V/MQL5-Google-Onedrive/actions
```

## What Happens When You Create a Release

### GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Validation** (1-2 min)
   - Validates repository structure
   - Checks shell script syntax
   - Runs automated tests

2. **Package Building** (1-2 min)
   - Creates `Exness_MT5_MQL5.zip` (32KB)
   - Generates SHA256 checksums
   - Uploads artifacts

3. **Docker Images** (3-5 min)
   - Builds for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
   - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
   - Tags: `latest` and `v1.21.0`

4. **Release Creation** (1 min)
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Uploads package and checksums
   - Extracts release notes from CHANGELOG
   - Publishes release

**Total Time:** ~5-10 minutes

### Release Assets

Users will be able to download:
- **MT5 Package** - `Exness_MT5_MQL5.zip`
- **Checksums** - `Exness_MT5_MQL5.zip.sha256`
- **Docker Images** - `ghcr.io/a6-9v/mql5-google-onedrive:v1.21.0`
