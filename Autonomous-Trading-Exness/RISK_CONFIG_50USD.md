## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

With a $50 account, you MUST use **very conservative** risk management:

1. **Risk per trade should be 1% or less** ($0.50 per trade maximum)
2. **Start with minimum lot sizes** (0.01 micro lots)
3. **Always use Stop Loss** - Never trade without it
4. **Limit number of open positions** - 1-2 trades maximum
5. **Use proper Risk:Reward ratio** - At least 2:1

## 📊 Risk Calculations for $50 Account

### Conservative Settings (RECOMMENDED for $50)

```

RiskPercent: 1.0% (0.01)
Risk per Trade: $0.50 maximum
Maximum Loss per Trade: $0.50
Lot Size (EURUSD): ~0.01 micro lot (depending on SL distance)
```

### Risk Breakdown:

| Risk% | Risk Amount | Max Loss/Trade | Lot Size (approx) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0.5%  | $0.25       | $0.25          | 0.01 (small SL)   |
| 1.0%  | $0.50       | $0.50          | 0.01-0.02         |
| 2.0%  | $1.00       | $1.00          | 0.02-0.03         |

TPMode: TP_RR
RR: 2.0
RiskClampToFreeMargin: true
RiskUseEquity: true
MaxLots: 0.01

```

### Why These Settings?

1. **RiskPercent: 1.0**
   - Risks only $0.50 per trade (1% of $50)
   - Leaves room for multiple trades
   - Protects account from quick depletion

2. **SLMode: SL_ATR**
   - Dynamic stop loss based on market volatility
   - Prevents stops that are too tight or too wide

3. **ATR_SL_Mult: 2.0**
   - Uses 2x ATR for stop loss distance
   - Provides reasonable stop loss placement

4. **RR: 2.0**
   - Risk:Reward ratio of 2:1
   - Win 1 trade to cover 2 losses
   - Improves overall profitability

5. **MaxLots: 0.01**
   - Limits position size to micro lots
   - Prevents over-leveraging
   - Safer for small accounts

## 🎯 Trading Strategy for $50 Account

### Maximum Positions:

- **1-2 open trades maximum** at any time
- Don't overtrade - quality over quantity
- Wait for best setups only

### Position Sizing Example:

**EURUSD Example:**
- Account: $50
- Risk: 1% = $0.50
- Stop Loss: 20 pips
- Lot size calculation:
  - Value per pip (0.01 lot) = $0.10
  - For $0.50 risk over 20 pips: 0.01 lot is safe
  - Result: Use 0.01 lot (micro lot)

### Drawdown Limits:

- **Maximum Drawdown**: 20% of account ($10)
- **If account drops to $40**: Review and adjust strategy
- **If account drops to $45**: Tighten risk to 0.5%
- **Emergency Stop**: Stop trading if below $35

- **10 Trades**:
  - 4 wins = $4.00
